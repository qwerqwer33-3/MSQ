ABSTRACT: The development of electrolytes with high ionic
conductivity and stable electrode–electrolyte interfaces is crucial for
the practical realization of solid-state sodium batteries. In this study,
the effect of heteroatom doping in a von-Alpen-type Na super ionic
conductor (NASICON) was investigated by substituting Zr4+ with Mg2+,
Zn2+, and La3+ to enhance its material properties and evaluate its
potential for solid-state sodium battery applications. Computational
chemistry was employed to predict the thermodynamic stability
influenced by dopant introduction and the changes in ionic
conductivity arising from crystal structure distortion, with the
predictions validated by experiments. The optimized Zn2+-doped
NASICON (Zn-NZSP0.07) exhibited the highest total ionic conductivity
of 2.74×10−3 S∙cm−1, representing a 4.5-fold increase compared with undoped NASICON (6.00×10−4 S∙cm−1). The material also showed
a high relative density of 99.1%, indicating a compact and well-sintered microstructure, as confirmed by a three-point bending test.
Furthermore, a high critical current density of 1.4 mA∙cm−2 was achieved in symmetric cell testing. Additionally, a Na3V2(PO4)3||Zn-
NZSP0.07||Na cell delivered an initial capacity of 103.9 mAh∙g−1 at 0.1 A∙g−1 and retained 73.4% of its capacity after 200 cycles. These
results demonstrate that optimal heteroatom doping is crucial for enhancing the performance of NASICON.
